# Web_Scraper

link to the website: https://powerful-peak-76495.herokuapp.com/

This website utilizes MongoDB for the database, Mongoose, axios, and ajax for creating, updating, gathering, and deleting the data from the database, Cheerio for scraping NPR for their articles, and a mix of Bootstrap, Handlebars, jQuery, and CSS for the front end.

The object of this website is to allow users to grab articles from NPR's website, save them for later viewing, and write quick notes about the saved articles.

The main challenges I had with this website were dealing with associating multiple notes with a single article and getting them to render properly on the page, this was solved with a little bit of reading up on the Mongoose documentation.

This website was my first experience with having to scrape a website so it was an interesting time getting everything working properly. I hope you enjoy it!
